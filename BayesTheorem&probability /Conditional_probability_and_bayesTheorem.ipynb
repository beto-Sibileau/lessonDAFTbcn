    "A laboratory blood test is 95 percent effective in detecting a certain disease when it is, in fact, present. However, the test also yields a “false positive” result for 1 percent of the healthy persons tested.

If 0.5 percent of the population actually has the disease, what is the probability a person has the disease given that his test result is positive?"
